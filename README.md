### CLIPS  
CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System)
is a rule‑based programming language used for building expert systems and AI applications. It provides a simple environment 
for creating knowledge‑based programs using facts, rules, and inference engines. 
### About this repository   
This repository contains solutions to basic CLIPS programming exercises 
for my Artificial Intelligence practical course. The aim was to gain hands-on experience with the tool.
Each task is implemented in a separate .clp file for clarity and easy execution.
